The Innovation Award honours the most creative and innovative designs in the field of participants. Every year the waterbikers put great effort into rethinking and reevaluating their designs in order to sustain competitiveness. Some teams bring new boats, some teams conduct finetuning or fundamental redesigns on existing boats.
Every Team may compete with one design only. The competition awards the best new design or improvement to existing design.</description></item></channel></rss>
